# The SKA Regional Centre Prototype at IAA-CSIC 

The Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA-CSIC) in Spain is leading the Spanish effort to host an SKA Regional Centre. We are currently developing an SRC prototype hosting a cloud computing infraestructure based on OpenStack aiming both to support users working with SKA precursors and pathfinders, and constituting a transversal, wavelength agnostic facility enabling knowledge exchange among a diverse community of users. We will build a platform intregrating different components such as a JupyterHub server and Virtual Observatory services, among others, crucial to address the challenge of extracting scientific knowledge in a reproducible way, and hence the adoption of Open Science values.

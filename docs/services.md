## Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) in the protoSRC can be pre-configured with or without a desktop environment. All VMs can be accessed by SSH via public-key authentication (we will need your public key to give you access). We also offer a desktop environment that can be accessed using either an RDP client or via web-based access. You can access the desktop by installing an RDP client like Remmina in your computer (see [remote access](https://spsrc-user-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_guide/#remote-desktop) section). Alternatively, you can access the desktop environment from any browser using [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org)

A partially restricted **sudo** access will be granted to install new software and create new accounts for your collaborators.

Radioastronomers interested in using the [KERN](https://kernsuite.info) repository can request a VM with
the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS pre-configured, or you can use the kern singularity images available in all machines.

Researchers can also request to have either [Singularity](https://sylabs.io) or [podman](https://podman.io)
pre-configured to run containerised workloads.

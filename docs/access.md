# Getting access

Request a virtual machine in the protoSRC cloud via email at ska-itsupport 'at' iaa.csic.es. Please briefly
specify your use case and computational requirements. We will be happy to discuss the details further to
provide you with the best possible resources.

# Features

Virtual machines in the protoSRC can be pre-configured with or without a desktop environment. If you choose a
VM with a desktop environment remote access will be offered via [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/)
and a minimal [Xfce desktop](https://www.xfce.org/). If you don't need a desktop environment for your research
project we can offer plain SSH access via public-key authentication.

**sudo** access will be granted to install new software and create new accounts for your collaborators.

Radioastronomers interested in using the [KERN](https://kernsuite.info/) repository can request a VM with
the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS pre-configured.
